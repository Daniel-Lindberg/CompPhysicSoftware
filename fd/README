This code has a fd.cpp class which is the finite difference 
code , intended to form a linear system representing a 2D
finite difference approximation to Laplaces equation on a 
square.
(2) Performs Gauss-Seidel iteration on that linear
system up to a specified number of iterations
or a specified tolerance.

With this is also a test.cpp class which has unit testing for this class.

It involves CppUnit as a testing framework.

To install CppUnit on your system :
Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libcppunit-doc libcppunit-dev
CentOS/RHEL: yum install cppunit

In our make file, you also need to link the cppunit.

to run the program:
1)make
2)./tests

Checkout the results that are produced in :
cppTestFd.xml
or the various GNU plots produced:
test_b.plt
test_phi.plt
